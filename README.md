# CornerCalculator
Calculates the corners of a square, based off a center point and a radius.

The center point is stored in two seperate variables, "centerX" and "centerZ", which are determined based off user input.

The radius is stored in the "radius" variable, which is determined based off user input.

This uses some basic math in order to calculate the corners of a square with a given center point on a grid, and a given radius.
